// Description: Build an employee management system with the following requirements:
// Use an abstract class Employee with fields like employeeId, name, and baseSalary.
// Provide an abstract method calculateSalary() and a concrete method displayDetails().
// Create two subclasses: FullTimeEmployee and PartTimeEmployee, implementing calculateSalary() based on work hours or fixed salary.
// Use encapsulation to restrict direct access to fields and provide getter and setter methods.
// Create an interface Department with methods like assignDepartment() and getDepartmentDetails().
// Ensure polymorphism by processing a list of employees and displaying their details using the Employee reference.
